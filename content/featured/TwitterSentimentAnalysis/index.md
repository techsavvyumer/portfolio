As part of the Datathon competition **"[DataDanics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d-NyEfjvayZ5ZQ775xmVXS24qk0-t5cz/view "DataDanics Datathon Certificate")"** organized by [Codanics](https://www.youtube.com/@Codanics "Codanics") and [University of Agriculture Faisalabad](https://web.uaf.edu.pk/ "UAF"), I developed a real-time Twitter sentiment analyzer with the goal of analyzing the sentiments of tweets.
